+ Return to velocity statistics from the Orion KPNO and SPM datasets
+ Coming back to it after 7 years!
+ In support of Jane & Sac's work on the 512-cube hydro simulations

* Data for Sac

** Velocity moment maps from Tere 2008 paper
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Moment-Maps/README
:END:
+ Data is in =OrionStats/Moment-Maps=
+ Filename pattern is =LINE_-040+070.wisomom-VAR-SMOOTH.fits=
  + =LINE= emission line:
    + =DOHha= H\alpha
    + =DOHnii= [N II] 6583
    + =DOHoiii= [O III] 5007
    + =oi= [O I] 6300
    + =siii= [S III] 6312
    + =siil= [S II] 6731
    + =siis= [S II] 6716
  + =-040+070= velocity range of window for calculating moments: \minus{}40 \to +70 km/s heliocentric.
  + =VAR= the quantity represented in the FITS file:
    + =sum=: 0-th moment, total intensity
    + =mean=: mean velocity (km/s)
    + =sigma=: RMS line width (km/s)
    + =peak=: velocity of peak emission (IGNORE)
    + =fwhm=: full-width-half-maximum line width (IGNORE)
  + =SMOOTH=: the interpolation method used (IGNORE)
+ The lines beginning =DOH= come from the dataset of Doi, O'Dell & Hartigan (2004AJ....127.3456D) and have a pixel scale of 0.534 arcsec
+ The other data (from SPM) have a pixel scale of 0.62 arcsec



* Structure functions
+ Initial work is in [[file:~/Work/BobKPNO/]]
+ Sac is now going to work on this [2014-01-16 Thu]
+ 


* Velocity channel analysis
+ [ ] Maybe add together the [N II] and [O III] cubes
+ [ ] Thin versus thin slices from the Orion data
  + Not so clear that there is shallower power spectrum in the thin slices than in the thin slices
  + But there is definitely a higher amplitude of fluctuations
  + Anyway, we need to measure it

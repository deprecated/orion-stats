+ Return to velocity statistics from the Orion KPNO and SPM datasets
+ Coming back to it after 7 years!
+ In support of Jane & Sac's work on the 512-cube hydro simulations
* Structure functions
+ Initial work is in [[file:~/Work/BobKPNO/]]
+ 
+ 


* Velocity channel analysis
+ [ ] Maybe add together the [N II] and [O III] cubes
+ [ ] Thin versus thin slices from the Orion data
  + Not so clear that there is shallower power spectrum in the thin slices than in the thin slices
  + But there is definitely a higher amplitude of fluctuations
  + Anyway, we need to measure it
